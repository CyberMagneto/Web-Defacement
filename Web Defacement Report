"AYA" a startup company located in Bangladesh faced a web defacement attack.

Hacker group named "ABC" claimed that they not only deface the website. They have some confidential information as well.

I found a leak information that listed current active hacking group in Bangladesh. 

Hopefully I will share the list very soon once I verified.
